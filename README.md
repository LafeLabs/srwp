## Replication Path

1. Create a page on this server, below this page by clicking on the link to [fork.html](fork.html), entering the name of the new page and clicking through the links, edit that page with [scrolleditor.html](scrolleditor.html), making some trival change, then click the button on the left side to get back to the main screen.  To delete, go up a level with the link to [../](../), go back to [fork.html](fork.html), click the button to turn "delete mode" on, then click the delete button on the newly create page. You have now created a page, edited it, and deleted it.  

2. Get a new web hosting account on either a free or paid hosting service above.  All domain names should be linked to physical places, based either on the local watershed geography or local street geography, with a non-commercial ending like .xyz or .net or .org rather than .com.  On the new web hosting account you have set up, create a new file in the main web directory called replicator.php, open that file in the text editor on the server and copy the [code found here](php/replicator.txt) onto it.  Point a web browser to the web address of your new page, followed by /replicator.php, then click on the link that appears to go to your new page, and grow the page using step 1.

3. Decide what the purpose of your page is.  A page can be thought of as a generalized document which is a symbolic representation of an action, what is that action?  By default it's just replication of this page, but as with other generalized document preparation systems like the MS Office suit it can represent any action including learning and physical creation(instructions to make things).

4. Spread links to your page in a physical space: encode the url on some kind of physical media and give it out to people located in a geography that makes sense relative to the domain(streets and water).  The minimal example is an index with the url written on it, handed to people while saying "self replicating web page".

This system represents a generalized document which can replicate, spreading a generalized action.
